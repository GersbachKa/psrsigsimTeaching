Implement some type of h5py data storage
Ways to do this:
1. Move components of bokeh_plot into this file. Have bokeh_plot return just
   the array. That way it can be stored in such a file (as I understand it)
   Have this file create the images and display them
2. Find a way to store a full bokeh.figure in a file
