Currently working on "PSSTTv2.py"

To use this:
1. Make sure to edit PSSTTv2.py so that the PsrSigSim import is directed at the correct place.
2. Go into terminal and navigate to the folder that contains the PSSTTv2.py (PsrSigSim_TeachingApp)
3. Type: bokeh serve --show PSSTTv2.py

This should make it show up in a browser. It will initially take a couple of seconds to generate the data, but should be quicker to start the next time it's executed
