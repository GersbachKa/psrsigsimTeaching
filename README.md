To start this program:
1. Make sure to edit PsrSigSim_TeachingApp/main.py so that the pssPath string is directed at the location of your PSS.
2. Go into terminal and navigate to this folder that contains the PsrSigSim_TeachingApp folder
3. Type: bokeh serve --show PsrSigSim_TeachingApp

This should make it show up in a browser. It will initially take a couple of seconds to generate the data, but should be quicker to start the next time it's executed
