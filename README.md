Currently working on "test3.py"

To use this:
1. Make sure to edit test3.py so that the import is directed at the correct place.
2. Go into terminal and navigate to the folder that contains the test3.py (TestApp)
3. Type: bokeh serve --show test3.py

This should make it show up in a browser. It will initially take a while to generate the data, but should be quick to start back up again
