<h1>Scattering</h1>
<p>Scattering is yet another effect on pulses from a pulsar. This is primarily caused by a portion of the light from a pulse that was initially scattered (bounced) away from the observer, but the refraction from the interstellar medium causes those sections to be redirected towards Earth. In the same way light bends as it enters a new medium, like a cup of water, radio light also gets refracted by the interstellar medium. Due to the differing path lengths that portions of the pulse travel, the resulting observations can generate a tail, often called a scattering tail. This diagram helps to explain why the pulse can have a tail:</p>

<p>Because this phenomenon is frequency dependent, lower frequencies are affected by it more than higher frequencies, the following activity shows that with lower frequencies you see this tail on the end of the pulsar, while at higher frequencies our gaussian pulse stays much more gaussian. Keep in mind that this is what a scattering tail would look like in a perfect world, and our observations look much messier because of noise from the telescope receiver, amongst other things.</p>
