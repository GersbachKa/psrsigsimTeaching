<h1>Scattering</h1>
<p>Scattering is yet another effect that a pulse from a pulsar can go through. This is primarily caused by a section of a pulse that was initially not directed at the observer, but the refraction from the Interstellar Medium causes those sections to be redirected towards Earth. In the same way light bends as it enters a new medium, like a cup of water, light also gets refracted by the Interstellar Medium. Due to the differing lengths that sections of the pulse travels, the resulting observations can generate a tail often called a scattering tail. This diagram helps to explain why the pulse can have a tail:</p>

<p>Because this phenomenon is frequency dependent, lower frequencies are affected by it more than higher frequencies, the following activity shows that with lower frequencies you see this tail on the end of the pulsar, while at higher frequencies the pulse is much more gaussian. Keep in mind that this is what a scattering tail would look like in a perfect world, and our observations look much messier.</p>
