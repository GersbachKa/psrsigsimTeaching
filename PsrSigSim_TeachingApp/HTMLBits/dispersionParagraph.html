<h1>Dispersion</h1>
<p>Dispersion is another effect that we must remove when looking for a pulsar. Dispersion is an effect where lower frequencies from a pulsar get delayed more than higher frequencies. The amount of delay is dependent on the amount of material (Free Electrons) between the pulsar and the observer (also called the Interstellar Medium or ISM), as well as the frequencies being observed. The value of the Dispersion Measure is given by the following equation:</p>

<p>In this next activity, you can manually change the dispersion measure and view the resulting plot of Frequency versus Time where higher frequencies are on the top. Do note that when the pulse seems to wander off of one side of the graph and appear on the other, this would actually be from a trailing pulse that came before the current pulse. This means that you could potentially be seeing 3 or more pulses all at the same time, just at different frequencies.</p>
